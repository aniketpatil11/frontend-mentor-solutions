## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Although this is a “newbie-level” challenge, it was a useful exercise in reinforcing the basics. I was reminded of the importance of planning layouts visually before writing code. Having the design reference open while coding made the workflow more efficient and helped me stay consistent with spacing, typography, and structure.
