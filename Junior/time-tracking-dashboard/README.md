## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Javascript
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use Javascript effectively with modern workflow. Most importantly learned to use `fetch()` api request to fetch `JSON` data.
