## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project provided figma design files, which helped me to learn about spacing in design. Most importantly it taught how spacing, fonts affect overall design and one needs to be consistent with it to make design visually appealing.
